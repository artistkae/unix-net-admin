Assignment
==========

For this assignment, you will research alternative DNS servers and select one
which you feel is the best alternative to BIND9. You will then write a brief
summary of why you feel that out of all the alternatives, this one is the best.
If you feel it's even better than BIND9, please explain that to. The only
requirements are that it's an authoritative DNS server, and it's not BIND.

As usual, please keep a detailed list of all relavent URL's to the sources you
used when doing your research. Also, please use the template restructured text
file, and update it accordingly (i.e. DO NOT forget to change key details like
your name and email address).

--------------

* A plain text file marked up with reStructuredText, based on this template:

    * https://raw.github.com/dougstanley/unix-net-admin/master/report_template.rst

* A section of the document where you describe your alternative of choice
  and why you chose it.

* A summary section, recapping your results.

* Your document should have a reference section with every url/source that you
  used listed.
