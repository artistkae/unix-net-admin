Assignment
==========

For this assignment, you will write a *"How To"* article describing how to to
setup a Dokuwiki wiki using Apache on a linux server. You can decide which
linux distribution to base your howto on, but make sure to state which
distribution you're basing your how to on in the beginning of the document.

There are a number of ways you can go about setting it up, and it doesn't
really matter which on you choose, so long as it involves using apache. Also,
please document setting up the latest version of Dokuwiki from source, and not
any packaged version that may ship with the linux distribution.

See the reference section for links to the various pieces of software you will
need. Also, please document all changes to any configuration file, in as much
detail as needed for some one to easily re-create what you have done.

As usual, please keep a detailed list of all relavent URL's to the sources you
used when doing your research. Also, please use the template restructured text
file, and update it accordingly (i.e. DO NOT forget to change key details like
your name and email address).


What to Submit
--------------

* A plain text file marked up with reStructuredText, based on this template:

    * https://raw.github.com/dougstanley/unix-net-admin/master/howto_template.rst

* All appropriate sections of the template should be filled in with the details
  of the how to.

* The how to should be detailed enough that even a beginner linux user could
  follow your instructions and successfully install Dokuwiki.

* Your document must have a reference section with every url/source that you
  used listed.

Questions
---------

Any questions, comments, or concerns about this assignment, please email me
(dstanle@uakron.edu) or see me before or after class.


Submission
----------

Please submit your homework as a plain ASCII text file, preferably formatted
in reStructuredText markup (see syllabus for references to rst syntax). Please
**DO NOT** submit any microsoft word documents!! Plain ASCII text only (UTF8 
plain text is ok too)! If you're stuck with windows, the old notepad program
will work. There are many others as well.

To submit, upload your plain text file to the dropbox on springboard labeled for
this homework assignment.
